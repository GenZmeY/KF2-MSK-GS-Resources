This repository contains resources from the Killing Floor 2 servers of the [MSK-GS project](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/msk-gs), such as configs, map cycles, banner images, and so on

# Structure
- **banners** - server banners (images on welcome screens);
- **common** - configs common to all servers;
- **instances** - config dirs of the main servers;

## Server management warning
[MSK-GS](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/msk-gs) servers used the [KF2-SRV](https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-SRV) management system.  
You can also use [KF2-SRV](https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-SRV), but keep in mind that I create it for myself, and unfortunately did not provide manual for it.  
I do not recommend using [KF2-SRV](https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-SRV) unless you have sufficient knowledge of Linux in general and CentOS in particular, as well as the ability to learn unknown tools.  
If you decide to choose a different KF2 server management system, you will probably have to adapt these resources yourself for your case.  

## Symlinks warning
I used symlinks so that different servers can use the same configs and map rotation cycles. They usually refer to files in [common](common) and [mapcycles](mapcycles).  
Keep this in mind when setting up your server. If you do not need symlinks, you can simply replace them with the necessary files. Otherwise use `ln -s <target> <link_name>` (linux) or `mklink <link_name> <target>` (windows)
